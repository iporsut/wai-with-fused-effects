# WAI with fused-effects package

I try to learn [fused-effects](https://github.com/fused-effects/fused-effects) package. I found this post https://blog.sumtypeofway.com/posts/serving-http-content-with-fused-effects.html is interesting to learn how to use fused-effects with the practical example. But when I follow the code on that post it has many point that cannot compile with the current version of fused-effects and GHC that I use. So I fixed that and push the code that it's work to this reposity
